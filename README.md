# Real Agencies Collection

- KSP 1.2.2
- Intended for use with the RealismOverhaul mod suite but works without.


This is a simple collection of agency-configurations for Kerbal Space Program and its RealismOverhaul Mod Suite.
Parts with appropriately set up manufacturer tags will show up in the VAB's manufacturer selection tab, including the manufacturer logo.
Depending on the agencies' 'mentality' setup, they might show up in mission control and give some missions. (WIP)
Furthermore, all agencies can be chosen as 'Mission flag'.

The descriptions are short versions taken from the first few lines from their respective wikipedia entrys.
The agencies' mentality was rather arbitrarily chosen, feel free to chime in. (WIP)
The respective logos are taken from wikipedia and were resized and rescaled by myself.
There are both 'original' as well as merged, fused or deprecated companies and conglomerates.
