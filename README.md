# Real Agencies Collection v1.0.3

- KSP 1.2.2
- Intended for use with the RealismOverhaul mod suite but works without.


This is a simple collection of agency-configurations for Kerbal Space Program and its RealismOverhaul Mod Suite.
Parts with appropriately set up manufacturer tags will show up in the VAB's manufacturer selection tab, including the manufacturer logo.
Depending on the agencies' 'mentality' setup, they might show up in mission control and give some missions. (WIP)
Furthermore, all agencies can be chosen as 'Mission flag'.

The descriptions are short versions taken from the first few lines from their respective wikipedia entrys.
The agencies' mentality was rather arbitrarily chosen, feel free to chime in. (WIP)
The respective logos are taken from wikipedia and were resized and rescaled by myself.
There are both 'original' as well as merged, fused or deprecated companies and conglomerates.

Installing instructions:
Standard procedures apply, first delete any old installments.
Unzip the 'RealAgenciesCollection' folder from within the downloaded archive into your "\KSP\Gamedata\..." folder, keeping subfolder structure. Launch the game. Smirk for a while.



Issues:
None so far.
If you use texture compression/memory saving gadgets, you might want to add RAC to the exceptions list, otherwise the logos might look bad.
