# Real Agencies Collection

- KSP 1.2.2
- Intended For use with the RealismOverhaul mod suite

Simple set of agency configs for Kerbal Space Program and its RealismOverhaul Mod Suite

This simple set of agency configs contains a multitude of real world companies involved in rocketry and aeronautics.
The descriptions are short versions taken from the first few lines from their respective wikipedia entrys.
The agencies' mentality was rather arbitrarily chosen, feel free to chime in.
The respective logos are taken from wikipedia and were resized and rescaled by myself.
There are both 'original' as well as merged or fused companies and conglomerates (example: Aerojet and Rocketdyne)
